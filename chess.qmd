This dataset comes from Lichess.org via Mitchell J on Kaggle, representing over 20,000 games of chess collected from users on Lichess.org. Data includes players' ratings, openings played, and outcome of the game (among other data). I accessed it via the TidyTuesday repo from October 1, 2024.

The dataset can be found here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess/data>

The following visualization shows the relationship between the number of turns a chess game takes and the difference between the two players' ratings. A positive rating difference indicates that the player playing white had a higher rating than their opponent, and a negative rating difference indicates that the player playing black had a higher rating for that game. The visualization suggests that when there is a large difference between players' ratings, fewer games with over 100 turns are played when compared to games where players' have a small difference in ratings.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
chess <- read.csv("chess.csv")
ggplot(chess, aes(x= (diff = white_rating-black_rating), y = turns)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Rating Difference",
    y = "Turns")
```
