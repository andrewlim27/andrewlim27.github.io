Hello! I'm Andrew, a first-year at Pomona College. I study mathematics and computer science, and I love their applications such as data science. Outside of the classroom, I golf for the Pomona-Pitzer Men's Golf team. My hobbies include sudoku and anything outdoors (I especially love the mountains).
