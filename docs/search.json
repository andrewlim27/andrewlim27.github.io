    "text": "This dataset comes from Lichess.org via Mitchell J on Kaggle, representing over 20,000 games of chess collected from users on Lichess.org. Data includes players’ ratings, openings played, and outcome of the game (among other data). I accessed it via the TidyTuesday repo from October 1, 2024.\nThe dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess/data\nThe TidyTuesday repo can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2024/2024-10-01\nThe following visualization shows the relationship between the number of turns a chess game takes and the difference between the two players’ ratings. A positive rating difference indicates that the player playing white had a higher rating than their opponent, and a negative rating difference indicates that the player playing black had a higher rating for that game. The visualization suggests that when there is a large difference between players’ ratings, fewer games with over 100 turns are played when compared to games where players’ have a small difference in ratings.\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors"
